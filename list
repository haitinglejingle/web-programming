Five steps for expanding dynamic array:

Fish *fish;

Fish *fish = new fish[capacity];

what if the next fish exceeds cap?

1. Make a new bigger fish array

Fish *newFish = new Fish[capacity*2];

2. Copy the variables over from old to
   new fish array

3. Delete old fish array

delete[] fish;

4. Set new fish array

fish = newFish;

5. update cap

capacity = capacity*2;
