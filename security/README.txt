1. The security assessment is fairly simple and straightforward. The first
   two issues identified covered more concrete problems while the third issue
   was more of a lack of good practice. I made an assumption that the grid was
   to be private to a user because it was not on the home page board, so it was
   a recommendation with consideration to unprecedented attacks. 

   The sections included the introduction, methodology,
   abstract of findings, issues found, and conclusion. The third issue's proof
   did not include a picture while the proofs of the first and second issues did.

2. Acknowledgements: none.

3. I spent 4-5 hours on this project.
