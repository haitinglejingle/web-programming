    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The product is a leaderboard for the game 2048 hosted at 
    https://boiling-coast-60915.herokuapp.com. The username, score, and 
    time/date the game was played are listed in order of descending score. This
    security assessment tests for vulnerabilities to attacks. The three route
    paths to test in particular are '/' and '/scores.json' requested using GET,
    as well as '/submit.json' requested using POST.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    First, I tried "black box" testing. Then, I looked at the code to target
    specific vulnerabilities I saw.
    Tools and methodologies I used include query strings, curl, and Burp Suite.
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
    One of the most severe, but easy to execute attacks in this product is 
    cross-site scripting. The username, score, and grid inputs are not sanitized.
    Another vulnerability is database injection. In this case, it is possible to
    get all the records, even though one might not have access to all the user
    data.
    Throughout the code, "null" is incorrectly used instead of "undefined" when 
    checking variables, which is a vulnerability that gives an easy window for 
    crashing the application if an undefined variable is accessed.  
    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
    <h3>Issue 1: Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Location: Mainly in the POST request /submit.json,
         getting the request body.</li>
        <li>Severity: High. The product is a leaderboard, but XSS can ruin the 
        layout of the entire site by embedding anything that HTML allows, 
        include fake scores and grids, and prevent access
        to the site through pop-ups. The least harm is annoyance, the most
        harm is ruining the purpose of the product.</li>
        <li>Description: The problem was found using curl. I wrote HTML to embed
        the video of Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen from Youtube as my username.</li>
        <li>Proof: Screenshot of '/'.
        <br><img id="ppap" src="ppap.png"></li>

        <li>Resolution:
         The issue can be solved by sanitizing the input. Remove angle brackets
        to prevent script tags. Although it can be pretty simple to replace the
        special characters, it may be a better idea to sanitize with a library
        that can sanitize the code more thoroughly.</li>
    </ul>
