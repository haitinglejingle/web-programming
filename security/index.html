    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The product is a leaderboard for the game 2048 hosted at 
    https://boiling-coast-60915.herokuapp.com. The username, score, and 
    time/date the game was played are listed in order of descending score. This
    security assessment tests for vulnerabilities to attacks. The three route
    paths to test in particular are '/' and '/scores.json' requested using GET,
    as well as '/submit.json' requested using POST.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    First, I tried "black box" testing. Then, I looked at the code to target
    specific vulnerabilities I saw.
    Tools and methodologies I used include query strings, curl, and Burp Suite.
