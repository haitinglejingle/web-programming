    <h2>Introduction of Security and Privacy Assessment</h2>
    <p>The product is a leaderboard for the game 2048 hosted at 
    https://boiling-coast-60915.herokuapp.com. The username, score, and 
    time/date the game was played are listed in order of descending score. This
    security assessment tests for vulnerabilities to attacks. The three route
    paths to test in particular are '/' and '/scores.json' requested using GET,
    as well as '/submit.json' requested using POST.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    First, I tried "black box" testing. Then, I looked at the code to target
    specific vulnerabilities I saw.
    Tools and methodologies I used include query strings, curl, and Burp Suite.
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
    One of the most severe, but easy to execute attacks in this product is 
    cross-site scripting. The username, score, and grid inputs are not sanitized.
    Another vulnerability is database injection. In this case, it is possible to
    get all the records, even though one might not have access to all the user
    data.
    Throughout the code, "null" is incorrectly used instead of "undefined" when 
    checking variables, which is a vulnerability that gives an easy window for 
    crashing the application if an undefined variable is accessed.  
    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
    <h3>Issue 1: Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Location: Mainly in the POST request /submit.json,
     getting the request body.</li>
    <li>Severity: High. The product is a leaderboard, but XSS can ruin the 
    layout of the entire site by embedding anything that HTML allows, 
    include fake scores and grids, and prevent access
    to the site through pop-ups. The least harm is annoyance, the most
    harm is ruining the purpose of the product.</li>
    <li>Description: The problem was found using curl. I wrote HTML to embed
    the video of Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen from Youtube as my username.</li>
    <li>Proof: Screenshot of '/'.
    <br><img class="resize" src="ppap.png"></li>

    <li>Resolution:
     The issue can be solved by sanitizing the input. Remove angle brackets
    to prevent script tags. Although it can be pretty simple to replace the
    special characters, it may be a better idea to sanitize with a library
    that can sanitize the code more thoroughly.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Issue 2: Database Injection</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Location: '/scores.json'. The injection happens when the username is 
    searched for in the database.</li>
    <li>Severity: The severity is medium. All the scores for all users
    can be returned, meaning anybody can access the entire database. However, 
    the program does not have very sensitive information. A score and date is
    not too important. The username could be searched elsewhere on the web, but
    also does not seem to pose much of a risk to be accessed.</li>
    <li>Description: The vulnerability was found by directly entering in
    a query string for the username. An example: '/scores.json?username[$ne]=' 
    with the query left blank or with a string.
    </li>
    <li>Proof: Screenshot
    <br><img class="resize" src="injected.png"></li>
    </ul>

    <li>Resolution: The issue can be resolved by sanitizing the input so
    that the input cannot have query operators.</li>

    <h3>Issue 3: Lack of Encryption</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Location: '/submit.json'.</li>
    <li>Severity: Low. The severity is low because the data is not too
        important in this case.</li>
    <li>Description: The grid is not information that the client has access
    to. A good extra step to take to prevent people from accessing the
    grid is to encrypt it before putting it in the database. For instance, 
    this may be good to protect against proxies or unknown attacks because
    encrpyted data, even after stolen, would still need to be decrypted to be
    useful.
     </li>
        <li>Proof: The lack of encryption is the proof.</li>
        <li>Resolution: MongoDB has encryption methods to encrypt the database,
         either in-flight or at-rest. </li>
    </ul>

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>
         <p>It is important for the layout of the product to be preserved. 
         The majority of the issues can be fixed by sanitizing user input 
         because the input could be anything, whether nonsensical and/or 
         malicious. To prevent access to too much data, preventing injections
         in the database and encryption are useful. The costs of better code
         is very little.
