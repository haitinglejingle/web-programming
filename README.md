1. The purpose of this Git repository was to document the progress of the work I
did throughout the semester. Another purpose was to get familiar with Git and 
storing our work on Github. 
There are several reasons for learning Git. One benefit is version control, so 
we can look at code in an earlier stage if needed. Another benefit is that we 
learned to collaborate on projects this Git repo. Learning Git also prepared us
for working in a real world scenario. However, one of the most important aspect 
working on this Git repository was being able to keep a record to show others
or look back on myself.

2. My favorite assignment was assignment 3, in which we used Node.js, Heroku, 
and the Express web framework to make a server-side web app while storing data 
in MongoDB. This assignment developed my conceptual understanding of how the
client, server, and database interact. It was especially as enjoyable to read
the code for 2048. I learned a lot just from reading and modifying 2048. In the
future, I will be more inclined to download source codeor maybe even collaborate
on open-source projects.

3. I think I grew a decent amount from day 1 of the course. I went into COMP20
hoping to learn how to like web programming. Naturally, I have always tended
toward lower-level material. I had used HTML and CSS before, but it had seemed
messy, inconsistent, and impractical to me. I learned more effective ways to
think about web programming, learned Javascript, and learned about server-side
and security as well. I feel like I really understand the appeal of web
programming now. 

4. The most important things I learned in this course: 
Documentation is really important. It is extremely important for myself and
other people I work with that the code I wrote makes sense, the application I
made can be expained, used, and understood. I have a couple examples, both from
the semester project, of why I believe this is important. One reason is that I
often referred to documentation to figure out specific things I wanted to do
with Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, or any other tool I was using. The
other reason is that my partner, Mar, often worked at different times as I did.
In addition to having clear code, the comments or documentation we left for each
other made it possible for us to pick up where the other person left off, making
collaboration flow smoothly.

(Bonus lesson from the course: Never trust user input! Everything is fun and
good until someone breaks your stuff because you didn't take into account of
security...)

5. As a computer engineering major, I want to start understanding computer
architecture, operarting systems, and embedded systems. I should probably 
learn some low-level programming first, though. I am taking COMP40 next semester
and EE14 (Microprocessor architecture) next fall. While taking this course,
there was a major DDOS attack in October that exploited security weaknesses in 
Internet of Things devices. Going forward, I will always take security into
account of the work I do, whatever combination of hardware and software that it
may be.
