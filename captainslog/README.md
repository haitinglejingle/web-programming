Lab6: Captain's Log

This is really not done yet

The files are index.html and README.md. jQuery was used to display messages
in the "log" section with the latest update showing first. Date is in a 
readable format.
Messages should be stored in local storage, but that's not implemented yet.

Note: According to api.jquery.com/ready, "$( handler )" is the recommended
syntax instead of "$( document ).ready( handler )" or any other variations,
which "still work but are deprecated." So, this is the syntax I'm using.
