Lab6: Captain's Log

This is really not done yet

The files are index.html and README.md. jQuery was used to display messages
in the "log" section with the latest update showing first. Date is in a 
readable format.
Messages are stored in local storage but old entries will not load into the log.

Note: According to api.jquery.com/ready, "$( handler )" is the recommended
syntax instead of "$( document ).ready( handler )" or any other variations,
which "still work but are deprecated." So, this is the syntax I'm using.

Acknowledgements: Just the web and a brief convo with Ming about localStorage.

Hours spent on this: 5
