Proposal


Title of project:
Garden Biodiversity game (working title)


Problem:
-   People don’t know enough about gardening and the importance of biodiversity.

Solution:
-   Our game will be an accelerated real time gardening game that teaches players about proper climates, soils, plant taxonomy and anatomy, and interactions between other plants. 
-   Players will learn about what makes a plant grow and what doesn’t. 
-   Users will be responsible for adhering to these plant qualities in order to keep them from dying. 


The project will implement the following four items:
-   Server side data persistence
    -   Garden/plant status
    -   Other users visiting gardens?

-   Client side data persistence
    -   Storing local garden

-   Frontend Framework
    -   Making website look pretty.
    -   Info about gardens/etc. locating

-   Push Notifications and/or SMS
    -   Sent alerts about garden updates
    -   Ex1: Log in now to get a new seed!
    -   Ex2: Your flower x needs attention!


Data to be collected/used:
-   Server time
    -   Used to gauge how long a plant has been growing, or how long it has been unhealthy
-   User info
    -   Phone numbers, emails, etc. to send notifications to users.
-   Local storage
    -   Keeps track of local garden


Algorithms:
-   An algorithm for plant health will be used based off of a numerical health system. 
-   Health indicators will be 
    -   water, 
    -   pests, 
    -   soil quality,
    -   sun. 
-   If any one of these numbers is negative for a full day, the plant will begin dying.
